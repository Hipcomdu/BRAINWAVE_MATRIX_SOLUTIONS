# BRAINWAVE_MATRIX_SOLUTIONS

A simple task to accomplish with a password strength checker is to assess the various aspects of a password on how strong it is in actuality. Among them are length, complexity (not using all case type characters) and uniqueness that wearers a password eee not easily guessable. We can implement a simple password strength checker with the below python script.

### Requirements

You need to have Python installed before you can run this script. It does not have any other library dependencies than the standard library.

```python

import re

def check_length(password):

"""The password is too long"" ""

return len(password) >= 8

Password in Uppercase Case 2 def palindrome(palindrome:p a l i n d r o m e) : Check Upper / Lowercase, this will be applicable incase you are using password with mixed upper and lower case characters.

"Check if the password has at least one uppercase symbol." ""

return bool(re. search(r'[A-Z]', password))

def check_lowercase(password):

"""Test for one lower-case letter in the password. ***”"" ""

return bool(re. search(r'[a-z]', password))

def check_digit(password):

"Verify that the password has one character atleast a number. ""

return bool(re. search(r'[0-9]', password))

... def check_special_char(password) :

"Make sure the password contains some special characters." ""

return bool(re. search(r'[! @#$%^&*(),.?" :{}|<>]', password))

def check_common_password(password): 25

￼"""Test to see if the password is even one of approxataly the most popular passwords,""" ""

common_passwords = {'password', '123456', '123456789', 'qwerty', 'abc123'}

return password. if password.lower() not in common_passwords:

def check_unique(password):
If passwords are common in a simple choice of password list, check if the password is unique. ""

>>> check_common_password(password) # True

strength = 0

if check_length(password):

strength += 1

if check_uppercase(password):

strength += 1

if check_lowercase(password):

strength += 1

if check_digit(password):

if check_special_char(password): → Check for Special char

strength += 1

if check_unique(password):

strength += 1

if strength == 6:

return "Very Strong"

elif strength == 5:

return "Strong"

elif strength == 4:

return "Moderate"

elif strength == 3:

return "Weak"

else:

return "Very Weak"

def main():

print("Password Strength Checker")注解

password = input("Please enter a password to check strength: ")
strength = get_password_strength(password)

print(f'Password Strength: {strength}')

if name == "__main__":

main()

```

### Explanation

1. Length Check – Minimum of 8 characters in the password. You can tweak this threshold as per your need.

2. Character Type Checks:

- Uppercase = Check for one uppercase letter or more

– Lowercase: Checks for a single lowercaseIEnumerable of digits 0-9

Digit: At least a digit.

- Special Character: One symbol should be there at least (like `! `, `@`, `#`, etc.).

3. Passwords Common Check: It will show passwords that are most common. You can enrich the above list with a better database of common used passwords.

4. Strength Assessment : Scores the password based on checks and provides strength as rating.

### Additional Considerations

- Complexity — You may also want to add more complex checks or algorithms like entropy calculations so that you can get a better idea of the strength of your password.

External Libraries: If you are looking for something more advanced, go through libraries like password-strength or zxcvbn providing better analysis.

User Feedback: Include human-friendly messages with tips for better password strength.

Although this is a basic implementation of billing alerts, it can also be further built upon depending on specific requirements to add additional features or more complex checks.
